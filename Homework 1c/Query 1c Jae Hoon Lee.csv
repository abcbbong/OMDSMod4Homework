When the car was diagnosed by the Toyota dealership, they identified the problem as an internal leak within the brake actuator. Luckily, nobody has been hurt attempting to drive the car, but it is still being driven to get it from home to the repair shop so anything is possible. The first symptom I could link to this was in 2023, when the car would not accelerate via the gas pedal after the brakes were pressed during cruise control. Turning off the car and turning it back on fixed the problem. Afterwards, the red brake symbol was turned on. From that point on, the brake light would only shine sometimes. leading me to believe there must not have been something wrong with the car, since nothing else happened after that. 2024 is when the red brake light and ABS symbol both lit up. The only information that I could find in the manual was to take the Prius to the Toyota dealership. I could not find details on the problem. I continued to drive the car regardless because there seemed to be no problem. After letting the car sit for a few months in 2025, I began driving it again, and it was fine. A month later, I turned on my car and was met with a loud beep that did not end. This was my final sign to take it to get repaired. The car has exceeded 200,000 miles. This fix is $3,205.40 at the dealership. My 2007 Toyota Prius is valued between $2k to $4k. The repair would cost more than simply buying another Prius. ",IVOQ,N,,N,N,N,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,V,,N,N

While driving at highway speed the glass panel on the body that is attached between the windshield and panoramic sunroof experienced an unexpected and total adhesive failure causing the glass body panel to become airborne and projectile at highway speed. Luckily it landed on the highway and shattered without injury.   The two recall campaigns reference this exact failure on cars where the panel has been previously replaced, however there is no information to suggest the original need for a previous repair. In this case, the vehicle did not have a previous repair on record, yet Mercedes claims this problem only exists in previous repair scenarios and refuses to complete the repair under the recall.   Logically, one of these two things MUST be true: 1.) The adhesive failure is born from the assembly process in the factory, in which case the recall should be expanded under the same safety concerns as the previously cited campaigns and Mercedes should be compelled to make the repair.  2.) There was a previous repair done to this glass on the vehicle and proper records were not maintained by Mercedes, in which case it falls into the scope of the previously cited campaigns and Mercedes should be compelled to make the repair.   I attempted to work directly with Mercedes on this but after escalation, they denied the request for repair under courtesy repair or under recall scope. I'm hoping for help from the NHTSA as simple logic suggests that either the vehicle should already be in scope of the recall, or that the recall scope is too narrow and was not properly investigated. Mercedes attempted several illogical excuses in an attempt to avoid responsibility, but they strained credulity at best. This same complaint even appears several times on the NHTSA page for this vehicle make/model, and the report doesn't list VIN. ",IVOQ,N,,N,N,N,,,,,,65,,,,,,,,,,,,,,V,,N,N

Without any warning, the gas pedal became completely unresponsive, and the car abruptly decelerated from 50 to 20 mph. This sudden loss of acceleration was incredibly frightening, especially with vehicles close behind me that nearly collided with mine. There were no warning lights or check engine alerts. Fortunately, I was able to safely cross all lanes and pull over before having the vehicle towed to a local Hyundai dealership. I shudder to think what might have happened if this had occurred on a highway at higher speeds. This is not the first time I’ve experienced serious issues with this vehicle. In February 2024, at about 17,000 miles, I received an urgent alert recommending a system check. At that time, the car was revving while idle and would occasionally lurch at low speeds. The dealership had difficulty diagnosing and resolving the issue, and my vehicle remained in the shop for over a month before they ultimately replaced the oxygen sensor. Since then, the car has continued to lurch intermittently — for example, when backing out of a parking space or in stop-and-go traffic. In fact, approximately 10 minutes before the June 3 incident, the vehicle lurched several times while moving slowly in traffic. When the car began to lose speed during the most recent incident, I pressed the gas pedal all the way down, but it failed to respond at all. I believe the current issue may be related to the unresolved problems from last year and represents a significant and recurring safety concern. I’ve also read in Tucson owner forums that other drivers have experienced similar issues, suggesting this may be part of a broader, systemic defect.

That would have been dangerous for us and anyone else sharing the road with us.   On a Sunday, leaving our house and driving down our street, three lights turned on on the dashboard display - traction, brakes, and ABS - and the brakes felt softer and less responsive than normal. After having gotten a diagnosis and repair estimate from the dealership, we carefully drove the car home to consider our options. We tried to get a second opinion from a trusted mechanic, but it sounded like the parts we needed were tightly monitored by Toyota and the original estimate for the repair from the dealership was above $3,000. After a few days, the dashboard warning lights turned off and the brakes felt back to normal. The whirring noise which had been happening roughly every 4 seconds had slowed to roughly every 10-12 seconds. We were told that this turning off of the lights sometimes happened, but that the issue was still the same. Prior to these lights turning on, the car had been making a lot of the whirring noises for some time, but it had never thrown the codes before that would have been picked up by a mechanic. At the time, we didn't recognize the sounds as a sign of an impending commonly recognized failure - only after doing some research did we find that this was a very common problem for a lot of Prius owners, especially for the given year and number of miles we had. There is an ""extended warranty"" for this part and repair, but while we were within the mileage limit, we were outside of the time limit and we were told at the dealership that Toyota would be inflexible about paying for the repairs.

My safety and others are put at risk because the issue makes it difficult to remain in the lane while going down the road.

The car has not been inspected by Honda, the police or anybody else.   There are no warning lamps or active fault codes. The issue was present when I purchased the car at around 80,000 miles and is still present at 123,000 miles. I also had a 2016 Honda Civic that had the same exact issue, starting at around 25,000 miles and lasting until I traded it in at around 80,000 miles. The dealer was never able to replicate the issue when I took the car in to have the issue corrected under warranty so they could never repair the issue. I’ve done intensive research on others having the same issue and there are a LOT of others having this same exact issue on the 10th generation (2015-2023) Honda Civic.

The car insurance company and 2 towing businesses declared the vehicle a total loss. The vehicle is with the towing company per car insurance company request. I don't know if it has been inspected. I did not see any warning lights.

The part addressed is #14001-3TA1E  but more specifically it is an issue with the value position sensor. It is a small part which dicates whether the Swirl or tumble control activates which triggers the P2004. If you look up the code it’s common side effects are as follows: Decrease in low-end engine torque: You may notice a decrease in acceleration, particularly at low RPM levels. Engine surging or sputtering: The engine may run unevenly, particularly when starting up. Sluggishness: The vehicle may feel less responsive to the throttle. Difficulty reaching higher speeds: You may find it challenging to accelerate quickly or reach your desired speed. Rough idle: The engine may run unevenly and potentially stall at low speeds or while idling.  2. Decreased Fuel Economy: The IMRC system's primary function is to optimize the air/fuel mixture for different driving conditions. When it's not functioning correctly due to being stuck open, it can negatively impact fuel efficiency.  3. Check Engine Light (CEL) Illumination: The Check Engine Light (or Service Engine Soon Light) will likely illuminate when the P2004 code is triggered. This is often the first indicator that something is wrong.  4. Potential for Severe Engine Damage: This is the most critical side effect. If the hardware for the IMRC butterfly valve plates becomes loose and falls into the engine, it can cause severe engine damage or even engine failure.   This being said you would think it would be an easily replacable part. Not in the slightest you have to buy an entire manifold 1300 msrp through nissan with no gurantee of it fixing the light. I have had instances of stalling / sluggishness since it has come on.  This seems imparitive to vehicle safety.",IVOQ,N,,N,N,N,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,V,,N,N

Reservoir was very low, I added 12 oz. DOT3 fluid…..brakes seemed ok.  Got up the next morning , brake low fluid light is on and all 12 oz of brake fluid are gone, not a drip anywhere to be seen.  Called  the dealer….basically because our VIN has not been listed in any recall, we are out of luck on any help with repairs.  Incident occurred in our drive, my wife was very lucky.   Ford has a serious problem.  We are the original owner, 2013 with 105871 miles. Vehicle is very excellent condition.  If this would have happened on the highway, serious injury or death to us or others would have been very likely.  Taking to the dealer on Monday June 9 for a  diagnosis and a serious talk.  Hopefully after a confirmation of master cylinder failure and leakage into the brake booster (which Ford knows is an issue), they will be able to repair under an expired recall that should have included our 2013 with the 3.5 eco boost engine. Dealer’s service dept. agreed with me over the phone but added not to get my hopes up because Ford did not list every VIN in the recall that they should have included.               Interestingly,  back in May, Ford notified us by mail, that as still the original owner there had been issues with the master cylinder and booster.   If we had a repair done, they would reimburse up to 700.00 if we could provide proof.   We have had no issues, nor any repairs, so we threw the notice away.  So, a month after the notification from Ford, here we are.
